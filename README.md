# Uh Little Less Dum CLI

Uh Little Less Dum is a free, open source note taking framework built with academics, students and developers in mind. This cli contains the build script to generate a complete Ulld application based on your [configuration file](https://uhlitlelessdum.com/configure), and will contain a continually growing list of features for the ULLD framework, so make sure to check back often and update frequently.

Learn more about ULLD by clicking [here](https://uhlittlelessdum.com), and if you can, please consider supporting the continued development of ULLD by clicking [here](https://uhlittlelessdum.com/sponsor) or through the Github sponsor links.

## Installation

_I'll get around to adding other package managers when the build script is in working order. If I forget, submit a strongly worded issue._

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Uh-little-less-dum/cli/releases) or install via:
